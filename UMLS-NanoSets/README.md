Semantic similarity and relatedness measures focus on identifying the pair-wise relationship between terms. 
Identifying groups of similar and related terms can be used in applications such as finding articles with 
similar content in PubMed, and clustering symptoms and disorders found in the text of clinical reports for 
postmarketing medication safety surveillance.The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
Standardized Queries[1] (SMQ) was created to specifically help improve adverse drug reaction signal detection
from the reports collected by the US Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS). 
The SMQs are manually formed by defining groups of MedDRA terms that are highly associated with a specific 
medical condition. For example, the medical condition glaucoma is assigned the two terms optic nerve cupping 
and eye pain as related conditions. Here we use the term categories in the MedDRA Standardized Queries as 
our evaluation data. There exists 67 SMQ categories and 7,031 terms that have been manually categorized into 
one or more of the SMQ category. In this project, we evaluate the efficacy (ability to produce a result) of 
using semantic similarity and relatedness measures in conjunction with clustering methods to identify groups 
of similar terms.
